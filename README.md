Subtitle .srt to excel and VoiceOver.doc alignment tools and scripts

Purpose: 
This toolset serves to 
merge ready subtitles with speaker timings list into a .doc Voice-Over script (without timings),

and to automatically convert .srt-file Subtitles (e.g., from youtube studio)
into height-aligned excel columns 
for joint cross-language/cross-version review, and easy re-upload.

See ToolGuide doc for further info.
